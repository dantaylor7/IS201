                        <p>My family is the most important thing to me in my life. I am the middle of 5 children and
                            have
                            two amazing parents. This is a picture of us this last Christmas. We all get along well and
                            have
                            a lot of fun with one another. Some of our favorite things to do together are have big
                            Sunday
                            dinners and to play pickelball.</p>

                            there a few times a year on average. We will always consider ourselves "Texans." Whether it
                            is down by the border at the beaches of South Padre Island, enjoying Dallas, going to Sea
                            World or the Alamo in San Antonio, or enjoying the beautiful scenery near Austin, Texas will
                            always have a place in our hearts. I have to say that "the Lone Star State" is a big part of
                            my identity.</p>

                        <p>Korea is one of my most favorite places in the world. I served an LDS mission in the Korea
                            Busan area (as well as the Louisiana Baton Rouge Mission). Korea and Korean culture has
                            become a large part of who I am. I have continued to study the language extensively and love
                            to be involved in anything that relates to this beautiful nation. I am hoping to one day do
                            international business working out of South Korea. My mission there meant the world to me,
                            and I have some of my strongest relationships with people I met here.</p>

                        <p>My family and I have lived in Utah for the past decade, and we absolutely love it here. At
                            first, it was difficult moving from Texas, but this truly has become our home. We love
                            enjoying the outdoors and all four seasons that Utah has to offer. As seen below, skiing is
                            something that I absolutely love about Utah. I have made some incredible friends here and
                            plan to spend a large portion of my life here. Utah is a great place to grow up and has so
                            many great places, attractions, and people to offer to the rest of the world.</p>

                        <p>Skiing is something that I've been doing from a young age. When I'm skiing I feel so much at
                            peace. I love skiing at various resorts across Utah. Whether it is with family or friends, I
                            can always gurantee a great ski experience. One of my most favorite places to ski--and where
                            I group up skiing--is <a href="https://www.solitudemountain.com/"

                            ski on, but every time I am there I am reminded about many wonderful memories that were made
                            there.</p>
